## Implementation Details
```
This is a single player tictactoe game. The game has a 3 difficulty level bot which chooses the level o difficulty randomly. The feature to choose difficulty will be added in the future.
The App class acts as an entrypoint into the game. The Board class defines the playboard used to play the game  and itsel is acts as the playfield. The class Bot is the computer player that plays the game in 3 different difficulty levels which are choosen on by random. State of the game and turn taken by the players are managed by Game class, it updates the state of the game quickly by taking in input from the GUI, basically it acts as a interface between the game and the user.
